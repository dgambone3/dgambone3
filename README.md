## 🪨 Former Geologist 📊 Future Data Scientist 📚 Graduate Student 👩‍💻Novice coder

### 👋 Welcome to my GitHub!   
<p >
I'm currently a graduate student at Georgia State University pursuing Data Science and Analytics focusing on Big Data and Machine Learning! I also have an undergraduate degree from Georgia Southern University in Geology, and had worked in the environmental field for the past few years focusing mostly on water quality. A few twists and turns later I found myself exploring the big, expanding world of data, and jumped right in! In my repos you can find a few of my past projects, but expect to see some more exciting things on here soon! 😄
